# Heritage Preserves: Technical Implementation & Support Log

## Project Overview
A simulation of a premium e-commerce brand designed to test and document high-level Shopify integrations, UI/UX optimization, and technical troubleshooting workflows.

## Technical Support & Troubleshooting Log

### Entry 1: Environment Selection & PIM Configuration
* **Issue:** Determining optimal platform architecture for a high-end merchant.
* **Resolution:** Configured a **Standard Development Store** to bypass trial limitations while maintaining full access to Liquid theme logic. 
* **Implementation:** Executed manual Product Information Management (PIM) for "Hand-Harvested Wild Fig & Honey Preserve," calibrating inventory tracking and shipping weights to ensure accurate logistical data.

### Entry 2: Integration & Theme Extension Debugging
* **Issue:** GemPages UI elements failed to render on the live theme.
* **Diagnosis:** Found the "Theme App Extension" (App Embed) was disabled by default in the Shopify core settings.
* **Resolution:** Manually activated the **GemPages Theme Helper** in the Shopify Editor, resolving the CSS/JS injection block and enabling the SaaS page builder interface.

### Entry 2: Asset Optimization & Brand Alignment
* **Issue**: Default theme imagery lacked the "Premium" visual weight required for a high-end e-commerce brand.
* **Resolution**: Sourced high-resolution editorial assets from specialized e-commerce libraries (Burst/Pexels), focusing on "Product-centric" composition to improve the store's Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) potential.
* **Technical Implementation**: Updated the "Hero" section using the Shopify Theme Editor, ensuring focal point alignment for mobile responsiveness.

### Entry 3: UX/UI Optimization & Visual Identity
* **Task**: Replaced default theme assets with high-resolution, editorial-grade imagery to establish a "Premium" brand identity.
* **Technical Implementation**: Leveraged the Shopify Theme Editor to recalibrate Hero section headings and CTAs ("Explore the Collection") for improved user engagement.
* **Result**: Significantly improved the store's professional aesthetic, aligning with the "customer-centric mindset" required for corporate SaaS support.
